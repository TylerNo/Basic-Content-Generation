Basic Content Generation

This program is fully automating the listed websites and social channels below with "low-level and low-quality" content. These are/were just an experiment getting ready for a high-quality content generation tool. This project was to learn the fundamentals involved in creating and processing different forms of content automatically. This project is currently live and still creating content for the listed pages, but it will be turned off sometimes in October 2023 when the VPS plan runs out.

If you're looking to use this project for anything, your best bet is to pick and choose certain components versus trying to get the full code working. I've removed all API keys, many of the request headers, and more.
